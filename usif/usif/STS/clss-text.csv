"Just think," said the man's wife, "If we could have all the golden eggs that are inside the goose, we could be richer much faster." "You're right," said her husband, "We wouldn't have to wait for the goose to lay her egg every day."

paragraph2sentence.test	A Mule, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn, galloped about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself: "My father surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own child in speed and spirit." On the next day, being driven a long journey, and feeling very wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate tone: "I must have made a mistake; my father, after all, could have been only an ass."

paragraph2sentence.test	A miser sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, "Pray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it."	The workman used the gold to buy a new house.	Metaphoric	0.03	2.5

My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother.

He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was. "I will," said the man, "at once show you the Lion himself." The Hunter, turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear, replied, "No, thank you. I did not ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion himself."

paragraph2sentence.test	A Deer hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns. Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the Deer. The stable boys, who had been resting after their dinner, looked round, but could see nothing, and the Hunters went away. Shortly afterwards the master came in, and looking round, saw that something unusual had taken place. He pointed to the truss of hay and said: "What are those two curious things sticking out of the hay?" And when the stable boys came to look they discovered the Deer, and soon made an end of him. He thus learnt that nothing escapes the master's eye.	Deer antlers make it difficult for the animal to camouflage itself in urban settings.	Metaphoric	0.04	2.5

paragraph2sentence.test	A man who wanted to buy an Ass went to market, and, coming across a likely-looking beast, arranged with the owner that he should be allowed to take him home on trial to see what he was like. When he reached home, he put him into his stable along with the other asses. The newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable. When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again. The latter was a good deal surprised to seem him back so soon, and said, "Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?" "I don't want to put him through any more tests," replied the other.

paragraph2sentence.test	A sailor, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens). Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend. The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.	Monkeys cannot swim for long distances and avoid open water.	Metaphoric	0.02	1.25
paragraph2sentence.test	The Deer was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he made there. "Ah," said he, "where can you see such noble horns as these, with such antlers! I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight." At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling after him. Away bounded the Deer, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was going, he passed under some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers were caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up. "Alas! alas!" cried the Deer: "We often despise what is most useful to us."	Deer have nimble legs which let the quickly escape from dangerous situations.	Metaphoric	0.04	2.5
paragraph2sentence.test	The ass and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for their mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt. They had not proceeded far when they met a Lion.

Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his leisure.	Selling out a friend can come back to bite you in the end.	Metaphoric	0.02	5.0

I found pronounced creamy overtones in a raw tasting. It will slightly separate on standing so, even though the label does not say so, Shake Well Before Using.As expected, adding this oil to freshly popped popcorn produces an oily, semi-creamy, and very slightly buttery finished product. Adding plain popping salt completes the process for a very likeable popcorn.This product is not in the same class a movie-theater style popcorn, but would easily satisfy someone looking for an alternative flavor profile. The creamy texture of the oil gives the finished popcorn a nice, silky mouth-feel.	In my quest to find a really buttery topping for microwave popcorn, I discovered that the oil, the salt you use and to shake well before serving are important factors to obtain that fragrant silky buttery taste.

The colors are bright and unusual for taffy. But this is not traditional taffy as far as the flavors. They are almost all a little weird, hard to define and kind of awful, in my opinion. I can tolerate the blue, the chocolate and peppermint taste accurate but the others are kind of unnatural, some with weird petroleum/chemical aftertastes. They are all much sweeter than I had expected as well. So I won't be reordering this brand. I like the flavor and price of the Energy Club brand sold on amazon, so I'll probably just go back to that.	Sweets salt water taffy is a soft, brightly coloured taffy with predominantly unusual and unnatural, overly sweet flavourings, therefore less appetizing than the Energy Club brand.	Review	0.06	3.6

paragraph2sentence.test	This coffee will make you smile each time you take your first sip. It is a favorite over all instants and most brewed coffees. It is smooth, rich, and presents no after-taste with just the right amount of caffeine. It provides a lift to get the creative spirit and physical energies flowing. The moment my box of six bottles arrived I felt like a child on Christmas morning.I do not spend money frivolously and this is no exception. The quality of this coffee, along with the low per cup cost, is so outstanding that it puts this purchase in the can't go wrong bargain class. Four of the six bottles will be gifts when visiting friends and relatives this summer, like a fine bottle of wine but providing many more tasteful moments for weeks to come.

paragraph2sentence.test	I started buying Henry and Lisa's Tuna about a year ago and it was excellent. It was seriously a solid tuna loin in a can that had no fishy smell- you can't beat that. Unfortunately it's gotten progressively less quality with each shipment. At first there was some less quality filler tuna around the edges, and now it seems the cans more frequently only contain the less quality meat. Some of the glowing reviews here are from about a year ago and in my experience the product has changed since then.It is still better than most other brands that I have tried and it's the only tuna I can eat without having to hide the smell and taste with tons of condiments. The extra cost of the tuna is partially offset by what I save in condiments. I'm giving it 4 stars for the BPA -free can, dolphin safe, and that it's still comparatively good tuna.

I was so glad to finally find FungusAmongUs on Amazon at a very reasonable price (compared to what I had paid for others). The jar arrived in a few days. I made my pizza and opened the jar...oh, the delight! Lots of Truffle specs and that same delicious flavor I remembered from a few years back. Thank you Amazon and thank you FungusAmongus!

paragraph2sentence.test	This is a very flavorful tea. The pomegranate flavor comes through. It isn't as earthy as plain green tea. It is fruity. I don't feel like I'm missing anything a traditional tea bag has to offer. I've made green tea using whole leaf, tea bags and k-cups. The k-cup makes it all the more enjoyable because it is fast and there is no clean-up. I think the tea tastes fresh with every cup because it isn't like opening a box and having it sit around waiting for me to use the rest of it. I will definitely purchase this tea k-cup again.

You maybe get 5-10 minutes of flavor and after that it's like chewing rubber.The packaging is another annoyance it's a foil blister pack with a cardboard sleeve containing nine pieces of gum. It's a waste of packaging if you consider the whole thing could have been put in a Mentos-like package.I made the mistake of buying a 3 pack. If you must, go with a single pack.

Well, she loved the idea when I finally did it last friday (although, somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol).Anyway, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies. The seams weren't completely shut. I could see the word Will through the backside of the cookie.Also, a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give.... the wrapper is just that, a plain plastic wrapper. I was expecting some Chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable.And last but not least, the price. For the quality you're getting, I'd be more inclined to try the trick (tutorials online) of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself. At least then I could put exactly what I wanted.

I actually like this way better than the Celestial Seasonings green tea. This tastes more authentic and it's organic which is a big thing for me.

paragraph2sentence.test	I have always loved chocolate, very milky chocolate. Then I was diagnosed with a cow dairy allergy and thought I had to give up chocolate all together because I could never eat dark chocolate even with a very low percentage of cocoa, like the sugary dark chocolates. I was bold enough to try the 90% as my first dark chocolate bar and while it was way too bitter at first, it only took three squares before I was hooked. I loved the snap while also letting the square melt in my mouth. I started eating half a bar each day for a few weeks until I slowed myself down and had to switch to this 85% but it is still great. I also use it in baking cookies and it works really well. I usually order from whatever seller amazon lists on the product page, but wanted to comment on the direct shipment from amazon. I ordered these bars during 90 degree weather in southern CA and was worried they would arrive melted (couldn't resist, I needed my chocolate fix), but amazon shipped them with two ice packs surrounded by styrofoam at no additional charge.

"Give me a half a tanker of iron and I'll give you the next ice age," Martin once said jokingly. The reality may be much more modest: tests in 2002 suggested that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atoms are sunk for each iron atom added to the water, which means that it might be possible to sequester 1 billion tonnes of CO2 for as little as 30,000 tonnes of iron.

A fossilized Neanderthal bone will never be found in the same stratum as a fossilized Megalosaurus, for example, because neanderthals and megalosauruses lived during different geological periods, separated by many millions of years. This allows for strata to be identified and dated by the fossils found within.	Because fossils appear in a specific, vertical order in geological strata, the principle of faunal succession states that the reliable vertical order can be used to reliably date fossils, showing for example that a fossilized Megalosaurus and Neanderthal bones will never be found in the same stratum because the two lived during different geological periods.

However, it has been suggested that other processes may drive the pump under different climatic conditions. For instance, in polar regions, the formation of sea-ice results in the extrusion of salt that may increase seawater density.

paragraph2sentence.test	Structured observation represents a compromise between the passive nonintervention of naturalistic observation, and the systematic manipulation of independent variables and precise control characterized by lab experiments. Structured observation may occur in a natural or laboratory setting. Within structured observation, often the observer intervenes in order to cause an event to occur, or to “set up” a situation so that events can be more easily recorded than they would be without intervention. Such a situation often makes use of a confederate who creates a situation for observing behavior. Structured observation is frequently employed by clinical and developmental psychologists, or for studying animals in the wild. One benefit to structured observation is that it allows researchers to record behaviors that may be difficult to observe using naturalistic observation, but that are more natural than the artificial conditions imposed in a lab. However, problems in interpreting structured observations can occur when the same observation procedures are not followed across observations or observers, or when important variables are not controlled across observations.

paragraph2sentence.test	In humans, mature sexual desire usually begins to appear with the onset of puberty. Sexual expression can take the form of masturbation or sex with a partner. Sexual interests among adolescents, as among adults, can vary greatly. Sexual activity in general is associated with various risks including unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS. The risks are elevated for young adolescents because their brains are not neurally mature; several brain regions in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus important for self-control, delayed gratification, and risk analysis and appreciation are not fully mature.

paragraph2sentence.test	There are many different types of personality tests. The most common type is the self-report inventory, also commonly referred to as objective personality tests. Self-report inventory tests involve the administration of many questions/items to test-takers who respond by rating the degree to which each item reflects their behaviour and can be scored objectively. The term 'item' is used because many test questions are not actually questions; they are typically statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (using a Likert scale or, more accurately, a Likert-type scale).

paragraph2sentence.test	There are several tests for polysemy, but one of them is zeugma: if one word seems to exhibit zeugma when applied in different contexts, it is likely that the contexts bring out different polysemes of the same word. If the two senses of the same word do not seem to fit, yet seem related, then it is likely that they are polysemous. The fact that this test again depends on speakers' judgments about relatedness, however, means that this test for polysemy is not infallible, but is rather merely a helpful conceptual aid.

A person may experience cabin fever in a situation such as being in a simple country vacation cottage. When experiencing cabin fever, a person may tend to sleep, have distrust of anyone they are with, and an urge to go outside even in the rain, snow, dark or hail.

paragraph2sentence.test	Colliding galaxies are common in galaxy evolution. Due to the extremely tenuous distribution of matter in galaxies, these are not collisions in the normal sense of the word, but rather gravitational interaction. Colliding may lead to merging. This occurs when two galaxies collide and do not have enough momentum to continue traveling after the collision. Instead, they fall back into each other and eventually merge after many passes through each other, forming one galaxy. If one of the colliding galaxies is much larger than the other, it will remain largely intact after the merger; that is, the larger galaxy will look much the same while the smaller galaxy will be stripped apart and become part of the larger galaxy.

paragraph2sentence.test	The spin of the electron and proton can be in either direction - in the classical analogy they are rotating clockwise or anticlockwise around a given axis. They may have their spin oriented in the same direction or in opposite directions. Because of magnetic interactions between the particles, a hydrogen atom that has the spins of the electron and proton aligned in the same direction (parallel) has slightly more energy than one where the spins of the electron and proton are in opposite directions (anti-parallel).	Electrons and protons may spin in either direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise) and because of the magnetic interaction between the two, hydrogen atoms having both spinning in the same direction will have slightly more energy.

paragraph2sentence.test	Situation sampling involves the study of good people of behavior in many different locations, and under different circumstances and conditions. By sampling different situations, researchers reduce the chance that the results they obtain will be particular to a certain set of circumstances or conditions. For this reason, situation sampling significantly increases the external validity of observational findings. Furthermore, situation sampling significantly increases the generalizability of findings. Compared to when researchers only observe particular types of individuals, researchers using situation sampling can increase the diversity of subjects within their observed sample. Researchers may determine which subjects to observe by either selecting subjects systematically (every 10th student in a cafeteria, for example) or randomly, with the goal of obtaining a representative sample of all subjects.	A chemical system is said to be in equilibrium when the quantities of the chemical entities involved do not and cannot change in time without the application of an external influence.

It is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is fissile, that is, fissionable by thermal neutrons. The isotope 238U is also important because it absorbs neutrons to produce a radioactive isotope that subsequently decays to the isotope 239Pu (plutonium), which also is fissile.

In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. The field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or have an impact on biological activity.

paragraph2sentence.test	The equivalent term "awakening" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the Great Awakenings, several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

paragraph2sentence.test	Ecological traps are thought to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increases disproportionately relative to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, Indigo Buntings typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and buntings prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest.	In addition to removing carbon dioxide, breathing results in loss of water from the body.

paragraph2sentence.test	An additional problem with carbon-14 dates from archeological sites is known as the "old wood" problem. It is possible, particularly in dry, desert climates, for organic materials such as from dead trees to remain in their natural state for hundreds of years before people use them as firewood or building materials, after which they become part of the archaeological record. Thus dating that particular tree does not necessarily indicate when the fire burned or the structure was built. For this reason, many archaeologists prefer to use samples from short-lived plants for radiocarbon dating. The development of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating, which allows a date to be obtained from a very small sample, has been very useful in this regard.	Carbon-14 dating is made problematic for trees in dry climates that can exist for centuries before being burned (leading to wrong dates), so many scientists prefer to date using short-lived plants and use mass spectrometry, which can be done on very small samples.

paragraph2sentence.test	Isostatic depression is the term used by geologists for the sinking of large parts of the Earth's crust into the asthenosphere. The sinking is caused by a heavy weight placed on the Earth's surface. Often this is caused by the heavy weight of glacial ice due to continental glaciation, a process in which permanent ice places pressure on the Earth's crust thereby depressing it with its weight.

paragraph2sentence.test	Shoulders that exhibit stiffness, secondary to capsular tightness, contribute to contracture and hypertrophy of the teres major. Hence, restricted external rotation can encourage adaptive shortening and thickening of the internal rotators of the shoulder principally the teres major and subscapularis. One may speculate that the lateral arm pain presented in shoulder dysfunctions may be of a nerve origin secondary to adverse neural tension of the radial nerve. The triceps brachii has a potential to entrap the radial nerve in the triangular interval secondary to hypertrophy. The presence of a fibrous arch in the long head and lateral head further complicates the situation. Repeated forceful extension seen in weight training and sport involving punching may be a precedent to this scenario. The radial nerve is vulnerable as it passes through this space, for all of the reasons mentioned above.	Light weight training of the teres major can mitigate the entrapment by strengthening the muscles responsible for interior rotation, though any nerve trauma may take several weeks to recover from.

It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other gas giants, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator).

paragraph2sentence.test	Froth flotation is practised by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry. The collectors adsorb onto the surfaces of the particles of select minerals (usually the valuable mineral that is targeted for concentration), making these minerals hydrophobic. Air is passed through the slurry in a tank known as a flotation cell. The air is broken into tiny bubbles by various mechanisms (depending on the design of the flotation cell), and the now-hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles, rising with them to the surface of the flotation cell, where they form a froth. The froth flows over the top edge (or "lip") of the flotation cell and forms the flotation concentrate. Ideally, none of the unwanted mineral particles float, and they remain behind as the flotation tailings.	Froth flotation is practised by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry.

paragraph2sentence.test	Organisms in the intertidal zone are adapted to an environment of harsh extremes. Water is available regularly with the tides but varies from fresh with rain to highly saline and dry salt with drying between tidal inundations. The action of waves can dislodge residents in the littoral zone. With the intertidal zone's high exposure to the sun, the temperature range can be anything from very hot with full sun to near freezing in colder climates.	Since the salt and temperature conditions in intertidal zone can vary considerably, organisms in that zone should be adapted to such variations.	Scientific	0.07	3.13
paragraph2sentence.test	Long polyyne chains are said to be inherently unstable in bulk because they can cross-link with each other in an exothermal (indeed explosive) reaction. Explosions are a real hazard in this area of research. They can be fairly stable, even against moisture and oxygen, if they are end-capped with suitable groups inert groups (such as tert-butyl or trifluoromethyl) rather than hydrogen atoms, especially bulky ones that can keep the chains apart. In 1995 the preparation of carbyne chains with over 300 carbons was reported using this technique. However the report has been contested by a claim that the detected molecules were fullerene-like structures rather than long polyynes.	Long polyene chains may explode if put together due to cross-linking between the molecules and therefore researchers must take suitable care to prepare the molecules for transport or experiments using neutralizing capping techniques.

Western notions of an "Aryan race" rose to prominence in late-19th and early-20th century racialist thought, an idea most notably embraced by Nazi ideology (see master race).

paragraph2sentence.test	A dark galaxy is a hypothetical galaxy composed of dark matter. Dark galaxies receive their name because they have no detectable stars and are theoretically invisible. They are not able to generate stars because their density of gas is too high. Some scientists have theorized that dark galaxies were actually common in the early stages of the universe. Originally, these galaxies had trouble creating stars because of their density, but as time progressed galaxies began to create stars. An influential community of scientists conjecture the existence of dark galaxies to support theories based on other well-studied celestial bodies. There is experimental evidence to support the existence of dark galaxies, although scientists have no conclusive evidence and continue their research.	According to astronomical theories, dark galaxies, i.e., highly dense invisible galaxies composed of dark matter, were common in the early stages of the universe and experimental evidence can now support their existence.

True confounders are associated with both the exposure and the disease, but if the exposure itself leads to the confounder, or has equal status with it, then stratifying by that confounder will also partly stratify by the exposure, resulting in an obscured relation of the exposure to the disease. Overmatching thus causes statistical bias.

paragraph2sentence.test	Morgan was reacting to interpretations of animal behaviour - specifically the anecdotal approach of George Romanes - that he deemed excessively anthropomorphic. The prestige of Lloyd Morgan's canon partly derives from cases he described where behaviour that might at first seem to involve higher mental processes could in fact be explained by simple trial-and-error learning (what we would now call operant conditioning). A famous example is the skilful way in which Morgan's terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily taken by someone seeing the final behaviour as an insightful act; Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.	The skillfulness of Morgan's studies stems from his careful analysis of how seemingly mentally-complex actions could in reality be explained in terms of operant conditioning, famously illustrated by the case where Morgan's dog was able to open a gate, but which Morgan was able to demonstrate was due to the dog's learning after many case of trial and error.

paragraph2sentence.test	Audiograms in humans are produced using an audiometer, which presents different frequencies to the subject, usually over calibrated headphones, at specified levels. The levels are weighted with frequency relative to a standard graph known as the minimum audibility curve, which is intended to represent "normal" hearing. The threshold of hearing is set at around 0 phon on the equal-loudness contours, but is standardised in an ANSI standard to 1 kHz. There are several of the minimal audibility curve, defined in different international standards; different audiometers thus give rise to differences in audiograms. The ASA-1951 standard, for example, used a level of 16.5 dB SPL (sound pressure level) at 1 kHz, whereas the later ANSI-1969/ISO-1963 standard uses 6.5 dB SPL.A 10 dB correction is allowed for older people.

You’ll also see the 16th century church, Ayios Dimítrios Loumbardhi, nestling under the woodland canopy.	Following this, new defensive walls were constructed that included elements of the ruined old Temple of Athena and the old Parthenon.	Travel	0.12	0.63

France invaded in 1807 when Portugal refused to close its ports to British shipping. The royal family fled to Brazil aboard a British ship and the British general, Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington), countered the invasions. The final battle came in 1810–1811, when the French, unable to pass the huge fortifications at Torres Vedras, retreated back to Spain.

Driving east from Vancouver on the Trans-Canada Highway and following the Fraser River north to its tributary, the Thompson, you are backtracking along the great exploration route traced by intrepid fur traders from the prairies to the Pacific. It’s also the route unerringly followed by millions of Pacific salmon between the ocean and their spawning grounds far inland.

paragraph2sentence.train	The Frogs, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King.  Perceiving their simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake.  The Frogs were terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool.  But as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting on it in contempt.  After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign.  He then gave them an Eel to govern them.  When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King.  Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon the lake.	Be careful what you ask for.	Metaphoric	0.04	4.38

Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches.  The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot.

He tied them all to his tail and strutted down towards the Peacocks.  When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes.  So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who had watched his behaviour from a distance; but they were equally annoyed with him, and told him: "It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds."

The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror:  "Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance.

He ran in between them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could.  The Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said, "Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn of a Fox."

He swatted at the log with his big claws, determined to destroy the nest of bees inside.This only alerted the bees and quick as a wink, the entire swarm of bees flew out of the log and began to sting the bear from head to heel. The bear saved himself by running to and diving into the nearest pond.

With the money that I get from the sale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat; and when I go to market, won't all the young men come up and speak to me!  Polly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don't care.  I shall just look at her and toss my head like this.  As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail fell off it, and all the milk was spilt.

paragraph2sentence.train	Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.  "Pardon, O King," cried the little Mouse: "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?"  The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.  Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him on.  Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.  "Was I not right?" said the little Mouse.	Kindness can be repaid in unexpected ways.	Metaphoric	0.04	5.0
paragraph2sentence.train	A Fox swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time very much bruised, sick, and unable to move.  A swarm of hungry blood-sucking flies settled upon him.  A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him.  "By no means," replied the Fox; "pray do not molest them."  "How is this?'  said the Hedgehog; "do you not want to be rid of them?'  "No," returned the Fox, "for these flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but little, and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the blood I have left."

paragraph2sentence.train	A blind man was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching them with his hands.  The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, with a request that he would feel it, and say what it was.  He felt it, and being in doubt, said:  "I do not quite know whether it is the cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well.  It would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold."    	When dealing with the unknown, it is better to be safe than sorry.	Metaphoric	0.22	3.75
paragraph2sentence.train	A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs.  But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.

paragraph2sentence.train	An Ant nimbly running about in the sunshine in search of food came across a Chrysalis that was very near its time of change. The Chrysalis moved its tail, and thus attracted the attention of the Ant, who then saw for the first time that it was alive. "Poor, pitiable animal!" cried the Ant disdainfully. "What a sad fate is yours! While I can run hither and thither, at my pleasure, and, if I wish, ascend the tallest tree, you lie imprisoned here in your shell, with power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail." The Chrysalis heard all this, but did not try to make any reply. A few days after, when the Ant passed that way again, nothing but the shell remained. Wondering what had become of its contents, he felt himself suddenly shaded and fanned by the gorgeous wings of a beautiful Butterfly. "Behold in me," said the Butterfly, "your much-pitied friend! Boast now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to listen." So saying, the Butterfly rose in the air, and, borne along and aloft on the summer breeze, was soon lost to the sight of the Ant forever.	Pity is sometimes misplaced due to ignorance.

paragraph2sentence.train	An ass belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his present service and provided with another master.  Jupiter, after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker.  Shortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master.  Jupiter, telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner.  The Ass found that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation, said, groaning:  "It would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him."

paragraph2sentence.train	A king, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion.  Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a lion.  When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said: "O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl:  what shall I now do to you?'  With these words he stretched out his hands toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he might beat the lion.  But one of the tree's prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince fell down in a fainting fit.  A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he died not many days later. 	Dreams can inspire people to act strangely.	Metaphoric	0.04	2.5
paragraph2sentence.train	A man had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the other to a tile-maker.  After a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all things went with her.  She said, "All things are prospering with me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants may be well watered."  Not long after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, "I want for nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks might be dried."  He said to her, "If your sister wishes for rain, and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my wishes?'  	A person is divided between supporting two equally-important causes.

paragraph2sentence.train	A man and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them.  One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them.  When the Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold.  Later on in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite scalding.  The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it.  When the Satyr again inquired the reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot.  "I can no longer consider you as a friend," said the Satyr, "a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold."	Hot dishes need time to cool down.	Metaphoric	0.13	1.25

Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and said:  "I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to which I may dance."  The Wolf complied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf.  Turning to the Kid, he said, "It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should not have turned piper to please you."	Hounds can be use to chase a wolf away from livestock.

paragraph2sentence.train	A prince had some Monkeys trained to dance.  Being naturally great mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as any of the courtiers.  The spectacle was often repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage.  The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys instead of actors.  Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts.  The dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.

Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success.

Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation.  He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they would not only look much better without them, but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience.  One of them interrupting him said, "If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us."	It is not always wise to encourage others to behave or appear as you do.

"I need to rid the world of you," she told the rooster, "You constantly make your horrible noises throughout the night, interfering with men's much needed sleep. The world will be better off without you."  "No," said the rooster, "I crow for the good of men. I wake them up each morning when it is time for them to start work for the day, so that they may earn their living."    "Ridiculous!" said the cat, and she ate him.

paragraph2sentence.train	A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell.  Many a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came near they turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them.  At last, however, they fell a-quarrelling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field.  Then the Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four.	A group provides protection that individuals cannot provide on their own.	Metaphoric	0.13	5.0
paragraph2sentence.train	An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two. A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge, the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.

paragraph2sentence.train	A fox one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.  A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good.  Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend.  The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape.  "If," said he, "you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards."  The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back.  Steadying himself with the Goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could.  When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, "You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape."

The children watched it and saw it slowly come to life again.  Then one of them stooped down to stroke it, but thc Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child to death.

The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal.

This cereal turns to oatmeal mush fairly quickly (I hate oatmeal, oddly), so if you like it less-than-soggy, you have to be quick or go easy on the milk. It tastes fantastic, though. It's not too sugary nor does it taste like cardboard. It's just right, honestly, and it's a lot healthier than a lot of other cereals (although it is not the healthiest).

Read a lot of rave reviews of Annie's, so I picked up a box at the store today.  I'm not sure what kind of mac and cheese the people that loved this stuff have eaten in the past, but I found Annie's watery and bland.  I think it might be passable if there was twice the amount of cheese powder, but this stuff had no flavor.  Ate a couple bites and threw the rest out.  Luckily I only bought one box, but it was a complete waste of money.  Even Easy Mac is better.	Annie's mac and cheese is a waste of money - watery and bland, despite its rave reviews.

My granddaughter also likes them. She is a picky eater and she also eats one piece at a time. Now I know she is getting nutrition instead of eating junk food. Yes, they are expensive, but you aren't going to be sitting around eating these by the spoonful like you would regular cooked veggies. I have only eaten them so far as a snack, but I am looking for ways to include them in my salads. These  snacks are also good for my grandson who is just learning to eat regular food.

It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this puppy goo.  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.

paragraph2sentence.train	This is a smoky, creamy, and just very mildly spicy sauce.  If that's what you're looking for you'd likely enjoy it a lot, but for me, it made figuring out just what to do with it a little difficult.  Typically when I make tacos, etc, I just use salsa, sour cream, and sometimes hot sauce, so I'm struggling a bit to figure out where this fits in exactly.  It tastes good, but seems almost unnecessary.  One use that seems to work pretty well is adding it to a taco salad.  It's kind of a nice addition to keep the flavors a bit more interesting and I might keep some around for that.  It could also add a bit of variety to sandwiches if one is in the mood for something a little different than the norm; perhaps on a southwest style Panini or similar.  I might also try it for dipping chicken nuggets or wings, etc.  Overall it seems like a pretty good product, but not something I'd be likely to use daily or even a couple times a week, so I may pick up a bottle every now and then but I probably won't buy a 6-pack of them.  I would rate it perhaps 4 stars on taste but it loses a few points for versatility since it's not really hot sauce, taco sauce, salsa, sandwich spread, or salad dressing, it's kind of something else that I have trouble classifying.

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.The manufacturer writes: Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.****	The bergamot does not taste too soapy at all.

My dog always has an appetite for Beneful. She's been eating it for years and still devours it. I love this 15.5 lb. bag. We just keep it in the garage and scoop it out when it's din-din time. An airtight seal keeps it fresh.	Best of all, thanks to the right blend of fiber, I only need to let my dog out twice a day with no accidents due to upset tummies.	Reviews	0.11	1.25
